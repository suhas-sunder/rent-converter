              <p>
                Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
                mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used
                by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more
                efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies set by the website owner (in this case,
                https://www.rentconverter.com) are called "first-party cookies."
                Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called
                "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party
                features or functionality to be provided on or through the
                website (for example, advertising, interactive content, and
                analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can
                recognize your device both when it visits the website in
                question and also when it visits certain other websites.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="Why do we use cookies?">
              <p>
                We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
                cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our
                Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or
                "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to
                understand how our Website is used and to improve performance
                and user experience. We may also use cookies for advertising
                purposes, including serving ads and measuring ad performance,
                where applicable.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="Analytics and performance cookies">
              <p>
                These cookies (and similar technologies) collect information
                that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how
                our Website is being used, improve site performance, and help
                diagnose errors.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may use analytics tools that set cookies or use similar
                identifiers depending on your browser and our configuration.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note: The specific cookies and identifiers used can vary over
                time (for example, due to configuration changes or vendor
                updates).
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="Advertising cookies">
              <p>
                We may display advertisements on our Website through Google
                AdSense and/or other advertising partners. Advertising providers
                may use cookies or similar technologies to serve ads, limit ad
                frequency, measure ad performance, and deliver ads that may be
                relevant to your interests.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Google uses cookies to help serve the ads it displays on the
                websites of its partners, such as websites displaying Google ads
                or participating in Google certified ad networks. When users
                visit a Google partner website, a cookie may be dropped on that
                user's browser.

            <Section title="How can I control cookies?">
              <p>
                You have choices about whether to accept or reject cookies. You
                can usually exercise your cookie choices by adjusting your
                preferences in a cookie banner or consent manager (if we display
                one), or by changing your browser settings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note that essential cookies may be required for core site
                functionality. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still
                use our Website, though your access to some functionality and
                areas of our Website may be restricted.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="How can I control cookies on my browser?">
              <p>
                The ways you can refuse cookies through your browser controls
                vary from browser to browser, so you should visit your browser's
                help menu for more information.
              </p>

            </Section>

            <Section title="What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?">
              <p>
                Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
                website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to
                time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or
                "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a
                unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has
                visited our Website or interacted with our content. In many
                instances, these technologies rely on cookies to function
                properly, so declining cookies may impair their functioning.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="Do you use local storage or similar technologies?">
              <p>
                Some site features and third-party tools may use local storage
                (such as Local Storage, Session Storage, IndexedDB, or similar)
                to store information on your device. These technologies are used
                for purposes similar to cookies, such as remembering
                preferences, improving site performance, and measuring usage.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can typically clear or control local storage through your
                browser settings. Disabling or clearing it may impact certain
                website functionality.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="How often will you update this Cookie Policy?">
              <p>
                We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect
                changes to the cookies and technologies we use or for other
                operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please revisit this
                Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of
                cookies and related technologies.
